# Algorithm 2 Elements add up to K
Project created to study and apply concepts of Time/Space and HashSet.

## Definition
This problem was recently asked by Google. Given a list of numbers and a number k,return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. 
For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17. 
Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Complexity Time/Space
Time = O(N)  (Hashset.contains = O(1))  
Space = O(N)
